The painful part of Shōgun is that whenever I mention it, no one has a clue what I\'m talking about—so I have to find a roundabout way of saying that I am not, contrary to the title, a nincompoop who cannot handle a thick paperback and so resort to manga and comics, or a combination of the two. The delightful part of Shōgun, however, is the plot. It is true that it has a slow start, but I do not think I have ever before cried because of what happened to a character. Shōgun made enamored with a cleaner, in some ways simpler, way of life. Yet I cannot recommend that anyone actually read this book, because then, you and I will be in the same predicament of others having no clue why we love this book about feudal Japan so much.',
